**OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT** <br/>
The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple, yet classic project often used to demonstrate basic concepts in<br/>
programming and game development. Here's an overview of the project and the common technologies involved:<br/>

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player simultaneously chooses one of three possible moves:<br/>

if/else if/else conditions check the player‚Äôs choice against the computer‚Äôs choice to determine the result. <br/>
**Rock**(represented by ‚úä)<br/>
**Paper** (represented by üñêÔ∏è)<br/>
**Scissors**(represented by ‚úåÔ∏è)<br/>
The rules for determining the winner are:<br/>

Rock beats Scissors.<br/>
Scissors beats Paper.<br/>
Paper beats Rock.<br/>
If both players choose the same move, the game ends in a draw.<br/>

This project typically allows a user to play against the computer or another human. The computer randomly selects one<br/>
of the moves, and the result is displayed based on the rules.<br/>

**Technologies Used**<br/>
**1. Programming Languages**<br/><br/>
Python: Often used for building command-line versions of the game due to its simplicity and readability.<br/>
JavaScript: Used in web-based versions, particularly when the game is embedded in websites, often using HTML/CSS for the interface.<br/>
Java/ C++/ C#: Can be used to build more sophisticated desktop or console-based versions.<br/>

**2. Randomization Libraries**<br/>
The computer's choice is usually made by selecting one of the three moves randomly:<br/>

Python: random.choice()<br/>

**3. User Input**<br/>
Python: input() for command-line input.<br/>

**4. Control Flow and Logic**<br/>
Basic programming control structures are used to determine the winner:<br/>

if/else if/else conditions check the player‚Äôs choice against the computer‚Äôs choice to determine the result.<br/>
